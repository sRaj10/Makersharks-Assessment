This approach sets up a basic Node.js application with Express, Mongoose for MongoDB, and a POST endpoint for searching suppliers.

--->  To create a supplier simply send req to "/api/supplier/create" with postman and send the data in json format.

--->  Now for search send the api req to "/api/supplier/query" with the proper field and correct names in json format and it will then show all the data of the suppliers .

--->  I can also show the data on the webPage with the search box included but not added to keep the assignment simple .

--->  I have used NodeJs in place of Spring boot as i know NodeJs frameWork only.
